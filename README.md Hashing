Hashing is a data structure technique used to map data to a fixed-size array, typically called a hash table. It involves applying a hash function to the data to generate a hash code, which is then used as an index to store or retrieve the data efficiently.

Here are some key points about hashing:

1. **Hash Function**: This function takes input data (such as a string or a number) and produces a fixed-size output, typically a hash code. The goal is to distribute data uniformly across the hash table.

2. **Hash Table**: It's an array data structure where data is stored based on its hash code. Each element in the hash table is called a bucket, and the hash code determines which bucket a piece of data will be stored in.

3. **Collision Handling**: Collisions occur when two different pieces of data hash to the same index. Hashing techniques like chaining (using linked lists or other data structures within each bucket) or open addressing (probing for an empty slot in case of a collision) are used to handle collisions.

4. **Efficiency**: Hashing provides efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations, typically with an average time complexity of O(1) for each operation. However, performance can degrade if there are many collisions.

5. **Applications**: Hashing is widely used in programming for tasks like implementing associative arrays (hash maps), ensuring data integrity in cryptographic algorithms, and optimizing database indexing for fast data retrieval.
